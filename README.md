# File System Tree 

This Java console application is a File System Tree Structure. It allows users to create and manage a tree-like file system with folders and files, similar to how real-world file systems work, like in our computer. 
This simulated structure uses Java objects to represent folders and files, arranged in a hierarchical tree format. Each folder can contain multiple files and subfolders, which can be navigated, displayed, added to, or deleted.

This application can display the tree, add, remove file or folder, can exit the program and has smooth workflow. 
    Display Tree: Users can view the entire file system structure starting from the root. The tree structure visually represents files and folders.
    Add Folder/File: Users can add new folders or files under any specified parent folder. If the specified parent folder does not exist, it can be created automatically.
    Delete Folder/File: Users can delete any folder or file by specifying its parent folder, which helps manage the structure.
    Interactive Menu: The application features an interactive menu that guides users to perform the above functions and exit the application when finished.
    
This application is a simple console of how hierarchical data can be managed in Java using tree data structures. A tree-based approach is commonly used in real-world applications, including file systems, organizational charts, and data hierarchies, making this application highly relevant for my learning purposes. This application's user interaction and input handling, handle user inputs with scanner introduces basic input validation and interactive programming. Developing this application reinforces concepts like tree structures, recursion, and collections. Also, aside from learning, my personal benefits of creating this application is to complete my assignemnt and expound my knowledge. This application also benefits the community by introduci9ng this as a helpful educational tool for beginners learning Java, data structures, or algorithms as it demonstrates core concepts in an accessible way.
